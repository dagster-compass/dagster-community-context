# Table Analysis Summary: compass-bigquery-demo.github_dataset.author_summary

## Overall Dataset Characteristics

- **Total Rows**: 2,173,918 records
- **Data Quality**: Excellent - no null values in any column (0.00% null percentage across all fields)
- **Dataset Scope**: This appears to be a GitHub author activity summary table covering the period from January 2015 to February 2024
- **Pattern**: Most authors fall into lower activity categories, with "Rare (<30)" being the most common activity frequency and "Low (5-49)" being a common commit count bucket

## Column Details

### author_id (STRING)
- **Data Type**: String (appears to be SHA-256 hash)
- **Uniqueness**: 1,799,074 unique values out of 2,173,918 rows (~83% unique)
- **Format**: 64-character hexadecimal hash values
- **Purpose**: Primary identifier for GitHub authors (anonymized)

### commit_count_bucket (STRING)  
- **Data Type**: Categorical string with 5 predefined ranges
- **Values**: "Low (5-49)", "Low-Medium (50-99)", "Medium (100-499)", "High (500-999)", "Very High (1000+)"
- **Distribution**: Heavily skewed toward lower commit counts based on sample data
- **Purpose**: Categorizes authors by total commit volume

### repo_diversity_bucket (STRING)
- **Data Type**: Categorical string with 5 predefined ranges  
- **Values**: "Low (2-4)", "Low-Medium (5-9)", "Medium (10-19)", "High (20-49)", "Very High (50+)"
- **Distribution**: Most authors contribute to fewer repositories (Low category dominant)
- **Purpose**: Measures how many different repositories an author contributes to

### first_commit_ym (INT64)
- **Data Type**: Integer representing year-month (YYYYMM format)
- **Range**: 201501 to 204002 (January 2015 to February 2040)
- **Unique Values**: 101 distinct time periods
- **Purpose**: Tracks when authors first became active

### last_commit_ym (INT64)
- **Data Type**: Integer representing year-month (YYYYMM format)  
- **Range**: 201501 to 224502 (January 2015 to February 2245)
- **Unique Values**: 152 distinct time periods
- **Purpose**: Tracks authors' most recent activity

### message_length_bucket (STRING)
- **Data Type**: Categorical string with 4 predefined ranges
- **Values**: "Very Short (<50)", "Short (50-99)", "Medium (100-199)", "Long (200+)"
- **Distribution**: "Very Short (<50)" appears to be the most common category
- **Purpose**: Categorizes authors by typical commit message length

### activity_frequency_bucket (STRING)
- **Data Type**: Categorical string with 5 predefined ranges
- **Values**: "Rare (<30)", "Occasional (30-89)", "Moderate (90-179)", "Active (180-364)", "Very Active (365+)"
- **Distribution**: "Rare (<30)" is overwhelmingly common in sample data
- **Purpose**: Measures how frequently authors commit (likely days per year)

## Potential Query Considerations

### Good for Filtering:
- **Time-based filtering**: `first_commit_ym` and `last_commit_ym` for temporal analysis
- **Activity level filtering**: All bucket columns for segmenting authors by behavior patterns
- **Author identification**: `author_id` for individual author analysis

### Good for Grouping/Aggregation:
- **All bucket columns** are excellent for GROUP BY operations and creating author behavior profiles
- **Time periods** (`first_commit_ym`, `last_commit_ym`) for trend analysis
- **Cross-tabulation** between different bucket categories to understand author patterns

### Potential Join Keys:
- **author_id**: Primary key for joining with other GitHub author-related tables
- **Time fields**: Could join with temporal dimension tables

### Data Quality Considerations:
- **Excellent data quality** with no nulls
- **Future dates warning**: Some `last_commit_ym` values extend to 2245, which may indicate data quality issues or placeholder values
- **Bucket consistency**: All categorical values follow consistent naming patterns
- **Author uniqueness**: ~17% of records represent duplicate authors, suggesting this may track authors across different time periods or contexts
