# Table Analysis Summary: compass-bigquery-demo.github_dataset.temporal_analysis

## Overall Dataset Characteristics

- **Total Rows**: 955 records
- **Data Quality**: Excellent - no null values across any columns (0.00% null percentage for all fields)
- **Data Structure**: This appears to be a pre-aggregated analytical dataset containing temporal patterns of GitHub activity
- **Time Span**: Covers 11 years from 2015 to 2025 (including future data points)
- **Key Metric**: `unique_repos` serves as the primary quantitative measure, ranging from 1 to 292,500

## Column Details

### Temporal Dimensions
- **commit_year** (INT64): Year values from 2015-2025, 11 unique values, no nulls
- **commit_month** (INT64): Standard month numbers 1-12, complete coverage
- **day_type** (STRING): Binary classification - "Weekday" vs "Weekend"
- **time_period** (STRING): 4 time segments covering 24-hour periods:
  - Night (0-5), Morning (6-11), Afternoon (12-17), Evening (18-23)

### Activity Level Classifications
- **activity_level_bucket** (STRING): 4-tier activity classification
  - Minimal (<100), Low (100-999), High (10K-99K), Very High (100K+)
- **contributor_level_bucket** (STRING): 3-tier contributor classification
  - Minimal (<10), High (1K-9.9K), Very High (10K+)
- **repo_activity_level_bucket** (STRING): 4-tier repository activity classification
  - Minimal (<10), Low (10-99), High (1K-9.9K), Very High (10K+)

### Content Characteristics
- **message_length_bucket** (STRING): 4-tier message length classification
  - Very Short (<50), Short (50-99), Medium (100-199), Long (200+)

### Primary Metric
- **unique_repos** (INT64): Count of unique repositories, highly variable (1-292,500)
  - 765 unique values suggesting detailed granular data

## Potential Query Considerations

### Excellent for Filtering
- **commit_year**: Time-based filtering, trend analysis
- **day_type**: Weekend vs weekday pattern analysis
- **time_period**: Time-of-day activity analysis
- All bucket columns: Activity level segmentation

### Ideal for Grouping/Aggregation
- **commit_year, commit_month**: Temporal trending and seasonality
- **day_type + time_period**: Activity pattern analysis
- All bucket columns: Activity level distribution analysis
- Combined temporal + activity dimensions for comprehensive analysis

### Aggregation Opportunities
- **unique_repos**: Primary measure for SUM, AVG, MAX calculations
- Excellent for calculating totals across different temporal and activity dimensions

### Data Quality Considerations
- **Future Data**: Contains 2025 data - queries may need date filtering for current analysis
- **Pre-aggregated Nature**: Data appears pre-summarized, limiting drill-down capabilities
- **Bucket Consistency**: All activity buckets use consistent naming patterns with ranges in parentheses

### Potential Relationships
- Strong dimensional relationships between activity, contributor, and repo activity levels
- Temporal relationships between year, month, day type, and time period
- No obvious foreign keys, suggesting this is a denormalized analytical table
