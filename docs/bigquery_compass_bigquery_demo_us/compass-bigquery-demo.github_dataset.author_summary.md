# Dataset Summary: compass-bigquery-demo.github_dataset.author_summary

## Overall Dataset Characteristics

**Total Rows:** 2,173,918

This table contains comprehensive author activity summaries from GitHub repositories, with **excellent data quality** - no null values across any columns. The dataset appears to be a pre-aggregated summary table that categorizes author behaviors into meaningful buckets for analysis. The data spans from January 2015 to February 2045 (likely with future dates for ongoing activity tracking).

**Key Observations:**
- High author diversity with 1,799,074 unique authors across 2.17M records
- All categorical fields use descriptive bucket labels with numeric ranges
- Time period data uses YYYYMM integer format
- Most authors fall into "Low" activity categories, suggesting a typical long-tail distribution of contributor activity

## Column Details

### author_id (STRING)
- **Type:** Unique identifier (appears to be SHA-256 hash)
- **Completeness:** 100% populated
- **Cardinality:** 1,799,074 unique values (83% of total rows)
- **Pattern:** 64-character hexadecimal strings
- **Usage:** Primary key for author identification, suitable for joins with other author-related tables

### commit_count_bucket (STRING)
- **Type:** Categorical with 5 ordered levels
- **Completeness:** 100% populated
- **Values:** Very High (1000+), High (500-999), Medium (100-499), Low-Medium (50-99), Low (5-49)
- **Distribution:** Likely skewed toward "Low" based on typical open-source contribution patterns
- **Usage:** Excellent for grouping authors by contribution volume, filtering active vs. casual contributors

### repo_diversity_bucket (STRING)
- **Type:** Categorical with 5 ordered levels
- **Completeness:** 100% populated
- **Values:** Very High (50+), High (20-49), Medium (10-19), Low-Medium (5-9), Low (2-4)
- **Usage:** Ideal for analyzing author specialization vs. breadth of contributions across repositories

### first_commit_ym (INT64)
- **Type:** Date in YYYYMM format
- **Completeness:** 100% populated
- **Range:** 201501 to 204002 (January 2015 to February 2040)
- **Unique Values:** 101 distinct months
- **Usage:** Perfect for cohort analysis, temporal filtering, and tracking author onboarding trends

### last_commit_ym (INT64)
- **Type:** Date in YYYYMM format
- **Completeness:** 100% populated
- **Range:** 201501 to 224502 (January 2015 to February 2245)
- **Unique Values:** 152 distinct months
- **Usage:** Essential for activity recency analysis, churn detection, and author lifecycle tracking

### message_length_bucket (STRING)
- **Type:** Categorical with 4 ordered levels
- **Completeness:** 100% populated
- **Values:** Long (200+), Medium (100-199), Short (50-99), Very Short (<50)
- **Usage:** Useful for analyzing commit message quality and author communication patterns

### activity_frequency_bucket (STRING)
- **Type:** Categorical with 5 ordered levels
- **Completeness:** 100% populated
- **Values:** Very Active (365+), Active (180-364), Moderate (90-179), Occasional (30-89), Rare (<30)
- **Pattern:** Most sample records show "Rare" activity, indicating typical contributor distribution
- **Usage:** Primary dimension for segmenting authors by engagement level

## Query Considerations

### Excellent Filtering Columns:
- **commit_count_bucket**: Filter for high-volume contributors
- **activity_frequency_bucket**: Identify active vs. inactive authors
- **first_commit_ym/last_commit_ym**: Time-based filtering and cohort analysis
- **repo_diversity_bucket**: Find specialists vs. generalists

### Ideal Grouping/Aggregation Columns:
- **All bucket columns** provide natural grouping dimensions
- **first_commit_ym**: Monthly cohort analysis
- **Combinations**: Cross-tabulations (e.g., commit volume by activity frequency)

### Potential Join Keys:
- **author_id**: Primary join key for author-related tables
- Could join with commit tables, repository tables, or user profile tables

### Data Quality Considerations:
- **No missing data concerns** - all fields 100% populated
- **Future dates present**: Some last_commit_ym values extend far into future (2245) - verify if intentional
- **Bucket consistency**: All categorical buckets include numeric ranges for clear interpretation
- **Time format**: YYYYMM integers require date parsing functions for temporal operations
